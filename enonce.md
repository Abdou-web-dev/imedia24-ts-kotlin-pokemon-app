Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly.

React Testing Library builds on top of DOM Testing Library by adding APIs for working with React components.
Projects created with Create React App have out of the box support for React Testing Library. I

End-to-end tests simulate actual user actions and are designed to test how a real user would likely use the application. In React, E2E testing helps to ensure that the code you wrote is functional and your app works as intended, allowing you to catch bugs in your code before your app is live.

A unit test is a way of testing a unit - the smallest piece of code that can be logically isolated in a system. In most programming languages, that is a function, a subroutine, a method or property. The isolated part of the definition is important.
Unit Testing is defined as a type of software testing where individual components of a software are tested. Unit Testing of the software product is carried out during the development of an application. An individual component may be either an individual function or a procedure.7 jui. 2022
The purpose of unit testing is to test the correctness of isolated code
Unit testing helps isolate specific code and determine if the unit works as intended. The goal is to facilitate early detection of code flaws that may be difficult to find and fix in later testing stages. Functional testing helps verify that each application feature works as intended.30 mai 2022

Jest runs the unit tests and Selenium provides and automates the grounds for cross-browser testing.

React is one of the most popular front-end frameworks today. Just like other frameworks, it has a set of tools for debugging called React Developer Tools (React DevTools).17 mai 2022
